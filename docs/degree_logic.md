# Degree Logic – CSUEB Computer Science (Lower Division)

This document defines the **academic rules and guidance** for planning the
lower-division Computer Science coursework at CSU East Bay.

It does **not** prescribe a fixed semester-by-semester schedule.
Instead, it separates **hard constraints** (must be enforced)
from **soft constraints** (recommended guidance) that a planner or AI
can reason over.

## Scope

- School: California State University, East Bay
- Major: Computer Science
- Level: Lower Division
- Assumption: Student has **completed or will complete Math 130 (Calculus I)**
  before beginning lower-division CS coursework.

---

## Courses Covered

- CS 101 – Computer Science I
- CS 201 – Computer Science II
- CS 211 – Discrete Structures
- CS 221 – Computer Organization & Assembly Language
- CS 230 – Computing & Social Responsibility

---

## Hard Prerequisites (System-Enforced Rules)

These rules must **never be violated** by the planner.

- **CS 101 (Computer Science I)**
  - Requires: GE Area B4 completion (Math 130 Calculus I or equivalent)

- **CS 201 (Computer Science II)**
  - Requires: CS 101 with grade C- or better

- **CS 211 (Discrete Structures)**
  - Requires: Math 130 (Calculus I) with grade C- or better

- **CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language)**
  - Requires: CS 101 with grade C- or better

- **CS 230 (Computing & Social Responsibility)**
  - No prerequisites

---

## Concurrency Rules (Allowed Pairings)

These course combinations are **explicitly allowed**.

- CS 101 may be taken with:
  - CS 211
  - CS 230

- CS 211 may be taken with:
  - CS 101
  - CS 201
  - CS 221
  - CS 230

- CS 201 may be taken with:
  - CS 211
  - CS 221
  - CS 230

- CS 221 may be taken with:
  - CS 201
  - CS 211
  - CS 230

- CS 230 may be taken with:
  - Any lower-division CS course

---

## Soft Constraints (Advisory Guidance)

These constraints **do not invalidate a schedule**, but are used to
recommend more balanced and realistic plans.

- Avoid pairing **multiple heavy technical CS courses** in the same semester when possible.
- **CS 201** is programming-intensive; pairing it with **CS 230 or a GE** is recommended for balance.
- **CS 211** is math- and theory-heavy; avoid combining it with another theory-heavy course when possible.
- **CS 221** is conceptually challenging and is best taken after students are comfortable with programming fundamentals.
- **CS 230** has relatively lighter workload and is well-suited to balance heavy CS semesters.
- A typical full-time student can complete all lower-division CS coursework within
  approximately **4 academic semesters after completing Math 130**.

## Notes for Future Expansion

- Difficulty ratings may be added later based on aggregated student data.
- Transfer-specific logic and upper-division dependencies will be handled in separate logic layers.
- This logic is designed to be machine-readable and extensible.
