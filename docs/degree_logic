- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) can be taken with CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility)


## Hard Prerequisites (Must have system enforced)
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) -> requires GE Area B4 (Math 130 Calculus I)
- CS 201 (Computer Science II) -> requires CS 101
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) -> requires GE Area B4 (Math 130 Calculus I)
- CS 221 Computer Organization & Assembly Language -> requires CS 101
- CS 230 Computing & Responsibility -> no requirements

## Soft Constraints (Guidance)

## Concurrency Rules (What can be taken together)
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) & CS 211 (Discrete Structures) may be taken together
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 201 (Computer Science II) may be taken together
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) may be taken together
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) & CS 201 (Computer Science II) may be taken together
- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken with any classes (Flexible since no requirement)
