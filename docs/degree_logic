#given these courses, what order can and should a student take them?


CSU East Bay

- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) can be taken with CS 201 (Computer Science II
- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) can be taken with CS 211 (Discrete Structures)
- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) can be taken with CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility)


## Hard Prerequisites (Must have system enforced)
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) -> requires GE Area B4 (Math 130 Calculus I)
- CS 201 (Computer Science II) -> requires CS 101
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) -> requires GE Area B4 (Math 130 Calculus I)
- CS 221 Computer Organization & Assembly Language -> requires CS 101
- CS 230 Computing & Responsibility -> no requirements

## Soft Constraints (Guidance)
- CS 101 should be taken as soon as Math 130 is completed. Pair it with CS 230 (light course) or a GE course to balance the semester.
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) is math-heavy and theory-intensive. Pair with CS 230 or a light GE in the semester it’s taken. Avoid pairing with CS 201 in the same semester for an average workload.
- CS 201 (Computer Science II) is programming-intensive. Best paired with CS 230 or a GE to reduce total workload in the semester. Avoid pairing with other programming-heavy courses like CS 221 for the same semester if possible.
- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) is conceptually challenging. Recommended after CS 101 and alongside CS 201 or CS 230 for lighter balance.
- CS 230 is flexible and light; it can be used to balance heavier technical semesters.

- Students should aim to take no more than two programming- or theory-intensive CS courses per semester to avoid overload.

- For a 4-semester lower division plan, consider spreading courses roughly like:

	Semester 1: Math 130 + GE/light course(s)

	Semester 2: CS 101 + CS 230 + GE/light course

	Semester 3: CS 201 + CS 211 + GE/light course

	Semester 4: CS 221 + remaining GE/light course(s)

## Concurrency Rules (What can be taken together)
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) & CS 211 (Discrete Structures) may be taken together
- CS 101 (Computer Science I) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 201 (Computer Science II) may be taken together
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) may be taken together
- CS 211 (Discrete Structures) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) & CS 201 (Computer Science II) may be taken together
- CS 221 (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) & CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken together

- CS 230 (Computing & Responsibility) may be taken with any classes (Flexible since no requirement)
